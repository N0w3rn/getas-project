      "content": "Soon Igor has found a puddle from which he drinks thirstily. But what is lying in the water? Fact check: \"Every year, 4.5 trillion cigarette butts from smoked cigarettes end up in the environment worldwide. Often only the plastic-coated filter remains from a smoked cigarette. This contains almost 4,000 chemical substances, many of which are toxic.\"1* In Berlin, researchers calculated 2.7 million cigarette butts per square kilometer. Rainwater dissolves more than half of the remaining toxins still in the cigarettes within half an hour. Wastewater treatment plants can largely break down the nicotine in the water, but around 70 percent of nicotine-containing rainwater ends up directly in bodies of water.2* \"An experiment by US zoologist Thomas Novotny from San Diego State University illustrates the toxicity: The researcher added one cigarette butt to one liter of water and let fish swim in it. After four days, half of the animals were dead.\"3*"

On average, a smoker consumes around 12 cigarettes a day. Each cigarette produces around 14 grams of waste, including the cigarette butt, packaging, and lighter. This adds up to around 6 kilograms of waste per year per smoker.3* Jonas exhales the smoke and watches as the smoke swirls in the cold air."
