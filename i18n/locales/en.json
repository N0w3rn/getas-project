      "content": "Soon Igor has found a puddle from which he drinks thirstily. But what is lying in the water? Fact check: \"Every year, 4.5 trillion cigarette butts from smoked cigarettes end up in the environment worldwide. Often only the plastic-coated filter remains from a smoked cigarette. This contains almost 4,000 chemical substances, many of which are toxic.\"1* In Berlin, researchers calculated 2.7 million cigarette butts per square kilometer. Rainwater dissolves more than half of the remaining toxins still in the cigarettes within half an hour. Wastewater treatment plants can largely break down the nicotine in the water, but around 70 percent of nicotine-containing rainwater ends up directly in bodies of water.2* \"An experiment by US zoologist Thomas Novotny from San Diego State University illustrates the toxicity: The researcher added one cigarette butt to one liter of water and let fish swim in it. After four days, half of the animals were dead.\"3*"

      "content": "Frightened, Igor rolls himself into a ball, hoping that his spines will protect him. Fact check: \"About half a million hedgehogs die in traffic accidents each year. In addition, roads cut through the habitat of these animals and make their lives difficult as insurmountable barriers. In residential areas, obstacles such as fences or walls also significantly restrict their freedom of movement. When hedgehogs can no longer reach neighboring areas, small isolated populations emerge in which genetic exchange is limited and the long-term survival of the species is at risk.\"1*"

      "content": "Jonas steps out into the backyard for a smoke. He lights a cigarette and takes a deep drag. Smoking is still very common in Germany. Around 28% of all Germans smoke regularly. On average, a smoker consumes around 12 cigarettes a day. Each cigarette produces around 14 grams of waste, including the cigarette butt, packaging, and lighter. This adds up to around 6 kilograms of waste per year per smoker.3* Jonas exhales the smoke and watches as the smoke swirls in the cold air."

      "helpContent": "Bird collisions with glass surfaces do not always result in immediate death, but often lead to broken bones, internal injuries, or impaired flight ability.

      "helpContent": "City pigeons are descended from domesticated house pigeons that were closely tied to humans over generations. After becoming feral in urban spaces, they often lack stable, species-specific structures for passing on nest-building behavior, so they react to materials and stimuli in their immediate environment.1*"

      "content": "Finally, Tabea's nest is finished. She is very exhausted, but also very proud that she managed to build a nest. In her nest lie old cable scraps, screws, a half-eaten apple, paper scraps, and the cigarette.",
      "helpContent": "In urban spaces, birds increasingly use human-made materials such as plastic, cables, or paper for nest building, as natural materials are only available to a limited extent. This practice reflects the close interweaving of animal life and human infrastructure and makes visible how animals in the Anthropocene survive in fragmented habitats shaped by waste.1* Tabea's nest is not a mistake, but a response to her environment."
